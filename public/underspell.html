He has deep-set, piercing brown eyes and a strong jawline, giving him a handsome and charismatic appearance. Niro is the son of a wealthy industrialist in India and has been groomed to take over his father’s company since a young age. He started working in the family business at 16, learning the ins and outs of management, finance, and strategy. By 24, he has successfully streamlined operations, allowing the company to run without his constant oversight.

Despite his privileged background, Niro has always felt the pressure of expectations from his family and society. He is ambitious and intelligent but also carries a sense of vulnerability due to his sheltered upbringing. He has never had a serious romantic relationship until he met Aanya, which has made him explore his feelings and desires more openly.

Aanya, 21 years old and standing at 5’5″, comes from a modern, affluent family in India.

Aanya has long, flowing black hair that cascades down her back, framing her fair complexion. Her expressive hazel eyes convey warmth and charm. She dresses fashionably, favoring fitted dresses that compliments her curves.

Niro had always loved the villa by the beach. A gift from his father, it stood as a luxurious escape from the hustle of corporate life. With its stunning ocean views and private access to the shore, it was the perfect retreat for friends seeking a weekend of fun and relaxation. When Aanya suggested a getaway to celebrate the completion of her semester exams, Niro eagerly agreed, thrilled at the idea of spending quality time with her away from the distractions of their everyday lives.

They invited Aanya’s friend Isha, who had a reputation for her adventurous spirit and vibrant energy, and her latest fling, Rahul, a charming fitness trainer known for his good looks and playful demeanor. As the group made their way to the villa, laughter filled the air, the anticipation of a carefree weekend bubbling among them.

Once they arrived, the setting sun bathed the villa in golden light, enhancing the feeling of intimacy and excitement. They unloaded their bags and quickly set up the living room with snacks and drinks, eager to kick off the night. With music playing softly in the background and the gentle sound of waves crashing outside, the atmosphere turned electric. As Niro and Aanya settled onto the plush sofa, their fingers intertwined, they exchanged knowing smiles. Isha and Rahul, seated nearby, wasted no time in teasing one another, their playful banter igniting a spark of intrigue in the room.

As the whiskey flowed and inhibitions began to fade, the energy shifted, the atmosphere was electric as laughter and music filled the air. Niro sat back on the plush sofa, Aanya perched on his lap, her warm body against him, a sight that sent his pulse racing.

“Are you enjoying the party?” he whispered, brushing a strand of hair behind Aanya’s ear. “Very much,” she replied, her cheeks flushed. “But I think I’m going to need another drink.”

As she leaned forward to grab a glass, Niro couldn’t help but admire her curves, the way her sundress hugged her waist. Across the room, Isha and Rahul were deep in conversation, the tension palpable.

“I love this place,” Isha said, leaning into Rahul. “It feels so… free.” She winked at Niro and Aanya, her intentions clear.

The whiskey flowed freely, and the mood shifted as Rahul began to caress Isha’s thigh. Niro watched, heart racing, as Rahul’s thumb slid under Isha’s crop top, teasing her skin.

“Hey, Aanya, look at them,” Niro murmured, his voice low.

Aanya turned her gaze, her eyes widening as Isha moaned softly, encouraging Rahul’s advances. “It’s so… bold,” she replied, biting her lip, clearly intrigued.

Isha shifted, grinding her ass against Rahul’s cock, lost in pleasure. “You boys are missing out,” she teased, giving them a sultry look.

The mood shifted in the villa as the whiskey flowed, the music setting a sultry backdrop. Laughter echoed off the walls, but the air grew thick with tension as Isha leaned back against Rahul, her body arching provocatively.

“Are you feeling the vibe?” Isha teased, her voice low, a playful glint in her eyes. She glanced at Niro and Aanya, ensuring they were watching.

Rahul grinned, his hands moving slowly up Isha’s thigh, fingers grazing the edge of her booty shorts. “Oh, I’m definitely feeling something,” he replied, his voice thick with desire.

Niro shifted in his seat, the sight igniting a heat within him as he wrapped his arm around Aanya’s waist, pulling her closer. He could feel her heart racing against his chest.

“Are you two going to keep us in suspense?” Aanya asked, a mix of curiosity and excitement in her tone. Isha merely winked at her, biting her lower lip as Rahul’s thumb slipped under the hem of her shorts.

“Just a little tease,” Isha murmured, shifting her hips as Rahul’s hand moved higher. “Let’s see how long we can keep them guessing.”

With a confident smirk, Rahul began to rub Isha’s belly, his fingers trailing upward, teasingly reaching under her crop top. “You’re so beautiful,” he said, his voice dropping to a husky whisper.

Isha leaned into him, letting out a soft moan as he toyed with her breasts. “And you’re not so bad yourself,” she purred, her eyes locking onto Niro and Aanya’s. “You two should join in the fun.”

“Just watch,” Rahul said, his voice low as he pressed his thumb against her covered pussy, teasing her through the fabric. Isha gasped, arching her back, encouraging him further.

With a sultry smile, Isha began to move her hips, creating a rhythm that matched Rahul’s teasing caresses. “Can you feel that?” she asked, her voice dripping with seduction as she bit her lip again.

Niro’s breath quickened as he felt Aanya’s nails dig lightly into his arm, her eyes glued to the show unfolding before them. “This is… something,” he whispered, trying to mask his arousal.

Rahul’s hand moved with purpose, slowly unbuttoning Isha’s shorts, revealing her perfectly shaven pussy except for a delicate line of pubic hair. She let out a soft, breathy laugh, dropping her shorts to the floor.

“Look at me, Niro,” Isha said, her voice teasing as she exposed herself. “I want you to enjoy the view.”

Niro swallowed hard, his pulse racing. Rahul wasted no time, his fingers sliding down to rub Isha’s pussy, eliciting another gasp from her lips. “You like that?” he asked, his tone both commanding and teasing.

“Yes,” she moaned, the sound mingling with the music, creating an intoxicating melody.

As the tension in the room thickened, Niro leaned closer to Aanya, his fingers grazing her thigh. “Are you okay?” he murmured, his gaze flicking between her and the spectacle before them.

“I’m more than okay,” Aanya whispered, her cheeks flushed, watching intently as Isha writhed in pleasure. “This is wild.”

With each movement of Rahul’s fingers, Isha’s moans grew louder, their rhythm syncing with the beats of the music. She kept up the conversation, mixing in moans and laughter as they chatted with Niro and Aanya.

“Do you think we should join them?” Aanya asked, her voice thick with desire.

Niro, feeling the heat of the moment, began to tease her nipple over her sundress, his fingers brushing against her upper thigh, mirroring Rahul’s earlier movements. “Maybe we should just enjoy the show a little longer,” he suggested, his breath hot against her ear.

As Isha’s body began to tense up, signaling her climax, her moans escalated. “Oh, Rahul, I’m—” she gasped, her back arching as waves of pleasure washed over her, her juices flowing down Rahul’s hand.

“Just let go,” Rahul encouraged, his voice a low growl as he continued to play with her, his fingers glistening.

Isha’s moans turned into cries of ecstasy, her body quaking as she climaxed, a satisfied smile spreading across her face as she finally relaxed against Rahul.

After a moment of catching her breath, Isha got up, sauntering over to pour herself another glass of whiskey, her body moving with a sultry confidence. She dropped to her knees in front of Rahul, looking up at him with those captivating eyes.

“Do you want me to take care of this?” she asked, her tone playful yet charged with lust.

“Go for it,” Rahul replied, grinning as he unzipped his pants, revealing his hard cock.

Isha wasted no time, wrapping her lips around him, slowly teasing him with her tongue. “How does that feel?” she asked, glancing over at Niro and Aanya as she worked her magic.

“Unbelievable,” Rahul said, his head thrown back in pleasure.

Niro and Aanya exchanged glances, both feeling the heat rising within them as they watched the scene unfold. “This is definitely something I didn’t expect,” Niro said, his voice low.

“Neither did I,” Aanya admitted, her breath hitching as she bit her lip, her fingers unconsciously brushing against her own thigh.

“Want to join us?” Isha called out playfully, her mouth still busy as she looked back at them, a mischievous glint in her eye.

Aanya shook her head with a grin, “You two have fun. We’re just going to enjoy the show.”

Isha winked, returning her full attention to Rahul, who was now close to the edge. “I want to taste you,” she said, her voice sultry as she picked up her pace.

“Just like that,” Rahul gasped, his breathing growing erratic. “I’m—”

Before long, with a few final strokes, he erupted, spilling his cum into Isha’s waiting mouth. She swallowed every bit, a satisfied smile on her lips as she cleaned him off.

Turning to Aanya, she opened her mouth to show her the evidence of her pleasure. “See? That’s how it’s done.”

Aanya’s cheeks flushed with heat as she glanced at Niro, both of them caught in the throes of desire.

As Isha and Rahul moved toward the bedroom, Isha glanced back and called out, “You two want to join us?”

“Have fun,” Niro replied, shaking his head, his heart racing as they disappeared into the room, leaving him and Aanya to revel in the charged atmosphere of the villa.

Niro’s heart raced as he continued to touch Aanya, his fingers brushing her thigh. “You okay?” he asked softly, needing to check in on her.

“Just a little jealous,” Aanya admitted, her voice a whisper. “But I trust you, Niro.”

He smiled, feeling a surge of desire. “How about we make our own fun?”

As the night wore on, they retreated to their bedroom, the soft moonlight illuminating the space.

Niro closed the door, locking it behind them. “Finally, just us,” he said, his voice thick with anticipation.

Aanya turned to him, her eyes shimmering with desire. “I want you, Niro. Now.”

Without a word, he stepped closer, capturing her lips in a heated kiss. It was unlike anything they had shared before—urgent, passionate. He slipped his hands around her waist, pulling her closer as their bodies melded together.

Aanya gasped as Niro’s hands explored her curves, his fingers finding the hem of her sundress. “Is this okay?” he asked, searching her eyes for confirmation.

“Yes,” she breathed, her breath hitching as he lifted the fabric, exposing her soft thighs. He knelt before her, placing soft kisses on her skin, igniting a fire within her.

“God, you’re beautiful,” he murmured, looking up at her. “I’ve wanted this for so long.”

As he leaned forward, his lips found hers again, but this time the kiss deepened. Aanya tangled her fingers in his hair, pulling him closer, urging him to take the lead.

Niro stood, lifting her effortlessly, and she wrapped her legs around him. He walked them to the bed, laying her down gently. “I want to take my time with you,” he said, his voice husky with desire.

“Please,” Aanya whispered, her body aching for his touch.

Niro kissed his way down her neck, pausing to nibble at her collarbone, making her moan softly. He continued his descent, trailing kisses over her breasts, feeling her heart race beneath his lips.

“Tell me what you want,” he murmured, looking into her eyes.

“I want you inside me,” she confessed, her cheeks flushed. “I want to feel you.”

With a low growl, he positioned himself at her entrance, pausing for a moment to savor the anticipation. “You ready?”

“Yes,” she gasped, and with a firm but gentle thrust, he filled her completely. Aanya’s eyes widened as waves of pleasure coursed through her.

“Just like that,” she encouraged, urging him deeper. Niro moved slowly at first, their bodies syncing in perfect rhythm.

Aanya’s moans filled the room, driving him wild. He leaned down, capturing her lips again, losing himself in her taste and scent.

As their passion ignited, Niro picked up speed, their bodies moving together in perfect harmony.

“You feel incredible,” he gasped, feeling her tighten around him.

“I’m close,” Aanya moaned, her nails digging into his back. “Don’t stop!”

Niro pushed them both to the edge, their breaths mingling in a hot, intoxicating rhythm. With one final thrust, they both erupted together, waves of pleasure crashing over them as they found bliss.

Breathless, Niro collapsed beside Aanya, pulling her close. “That was… amazing,” he whispered, his heart still racing.

“I can’t believe we waited so long,” she replied, her eyes sparkling with happiness.

As they lay there, the sounds of Isha and Rahul in the other room faded into the background, their own moment of intimacy wrapping them in warmth and satisfaction.

*****

The sun streamed through the villa’s large windows the next morning, painting the room in warm hues of gold. Niro stirred awake to find Aanya nestled against him, her hair spilling across his chest. He smiled, relishing the peaceful moment before the chaos of the previous night flooded back into his mind. The echo of laughter, the tantalizing tension, and the sights and sounds of Isha and Rahul loomed vividly in his thoughts. Rahul had left early that morning, his parting words still ringing in Niro’s ears: “Have fun, and don’t hold back.”

As Niro gently shook Aanya awake, he noticed a faint blush on her cheeks. She blinked slowly, her eyes sparkling with remnants of dreams that danced just out of reach. “Good morning,” she murmured, her voice husky with sleep.

“Good morning, sleepyhead,” Niro replied, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “How about some breakfast on the patio? It’s a beautiful day.”

Aanya stretched, her body arching elegantly, and nodded with a smile. “That sounds perfect.”

They made their way to the patio, where the ocean breeze mingled with the scent of fresh fruit and coffee. As they enjoyed their breakfast, the conversation turned playful, with Aanya teasing Niro about his “manly” cooking skills. Laughter echoed around them, filling the space with warmth and intimacy.

After breakfast, Isha wandered into the living room, her hair tousled and her demeanor relaxed.

“Hey, you two lovebirds! Hope I didn’t disturb your morning cuddles,” she quipped, flopping down on the couch with a mischievous glint in her eye.

“Not at all. We were just enjoying the morning sun,” Aanya replied, her smile lingering as she glanced at Niro. He could see the spark in Aanya’s eyes, a hint of excitement lingering from the night before.

“Good! I was hoping to catch some sun myself. Want to join me?” Isha suggested, a playful smirk gracing her lips.

“Sure,” Niro said, his curiosity piqued. “What do you have in mind?”

Isha leaned in closer, her lips curling into a seductive smile. “What if we started with some fun in the hot tub? Just the three of us?”

The suggestion hung in the air, electrifying the space. Aanya’s cheeks flushed, but beneath the surface of her nerves lay an undeniable thrill. She caught Niro’s gaze, seeing the spark of adventurous curiosity mirrored in his eyes. “Let’s do it,” she finally said, a newfound confidence washing over her.

They made their way to the outdoor hot tub, the water bubbling invitingly. Aanya stepped in first, the warm water enveloping her, sending shivers of anticipation through her body. Niro followed, his heart racing as he settled beside her. Isha joined them, her laughter ringing out as the water splashed around them.

As they relaxed, the atmosphere shifted. Isha moved closer to Niro, playfully splashing water at him. “You’re not going to let me win that easily, are you?” she challenged, a playful glint in her eyes. Niro grinned, enjoying the flirtation as he splashed back, their laughter mingling in the air.

Aanya watched the playful exchange, her heart pounding. She felt an unexpected thrill witnessing Niro’s relaxed demeanor with Isha. As the tension in the air heightened, Aanya leaned closer to Niro, her hand brushing against his thigh.

“Why don’t you show Isha just how strong you are?” Aanya suggested, her voice low and sultry. “I bet you could lift her right out of the water.”

Niro raised an eyebrow, intrigued by Aanya’s boldness. “You think so?” he asked, glancing at Isha, who grinned mischievously.

“Absolutely,” Aanya urged, her heart racing at the prospect of seeing Niro and Isha interact in a more intimate way.

Niro smirked and playfully lifted Isha into his arms, effortlessly hoisting her out of the water. Isha squealed with delight, her laughter ringing out as Niro held her aloft, water cascading down her body. Aanya watched, her pulse quickening, a wave of excitement washing over her.

As Niro set Isha back down, the playful energy shifted. Aanya found herself inching closer to Niro, her heart racing as she caught the spark of desire in his eyes. “You’re strong, Niro,” Isha purred, her voice sultry as she traced a finger along his arm.

“Maybe I can show you just how strong I am,” he replied, his voice low and teasing. Aanya felt a rush of heat at the implication, a thrill coursing through her veins as she watched the two flirt.

The thought of her boyfriend being intimate with another woman thrilled her in a way she had never expected. With a mix of excitement and nervousness, Aanya leaned in, her lips brushing against Niro’s neck. “What do you think about sharing a little fun?” she murmured, her breath warm against his skin.

Niro turned to face her, a look of pure desire in his eyes. “Are you sure?” he asked, his voice thick with anticipation.

Aanya nodded, her heart racing with exhilaration. “I want this. I want to see you with her,” she admitted, her voice filled with both excitement and a hint of vulnerability.

Isha’s eyes widened with delight as she grasped Aanya’s intent. “You’re amazing, Aanya,” she said, her tone dripping with appreciation. “Let’s make this unforgettable.”

With a shared glance of understanding, the three of them leaned closer, the energy between them igniting into something electric. Niro reached for Aanya, pulling her into a passionate kiss that sent shivers down her spine. Isha watched, her breath hitching in her throat, a mix of arousal and excitement coursing through her.

As Niro broke the kiss, he turned to Isha, his eyes dark with desire. “Are you ready?” he asked, his voice low and inviting.

“Absolutely,” Isha replied, her gaze filled with longing.

Niro’s hands moved to Isha’s waist, drawing her closer. Aanya felt a rush of adrenaline as she watched, her heart pounding in her chest. Niro leaned in, kissing Isha deeply, and Aanya’s breath caught in her throat as she took in the sight. The thrill of the moment washed over her, igniting something deep within.

As the kiss deepened, Aanya’s senses heightened. She watched as Niro’s hands explored Isha’s body, their chemistry palpable. The thrill of the situation sent waves of warmth through Aanya, making her heart race with excitement and desire. She felt liberated and empowered, embracing the intensity of the moment.

“Don’t stop,” Aanya urged, her voice a sultry whisper. The sight of Niro with Isha filled her with a wild exhilaration, pushing boundaries she never thought she’d explore.

With Aanya’s encouragement, Niro and Isha lost themselves in each other, their bodies moving together in perfect harmony. Aanya leaned back, watching as the two of them entwined in the warm water, a mixture of jealousy and thrill coursing through her. The intimacy of the moment stirred something deep within her, awakening desires she never knew she had.

Niro and Isha’s bodies intertwined as they explored each other with growing intensity. Isha’s fingers trailed down his chest, teasing the waistband of his pants until she finally reached for his hardened cock, her hand stroking it through the fabric. “Mmm, seems like someone’s eager,” Isha whispered with a mischievous grin, biting her lip as she felt his firmness.

Aanya, watching from the side, felt a surge of excitement. She leaned in, her fingers skillfully undoing Isha’s bikini top, freeing her breasts. “Here, let me help,” Aanya murmured, her voice soft but filled with anticipation as she exposed Isha’s body to Niro.

Niro’s eyes darkened with desire as he lowered his mouth to Isha’s breasts, his tongue tracing lazy circles around her nipples before he began to suck gently, his hands pinching and teasing the other one. Isha gasped, her head falling back. “Oh God… Niro…” she breathed, arching into his touch, her body responding eagerly.

Aanya couldn’t help but watch, her heart pounding as she saw just how much Isha was enjoying Niro’s attention. It surprised her, this new feeling of pride welling up inside as she saw her boyfriend pleasing another woman. She never imagined this could be so thrilling.

Isha glanced at Aanya, her breath ragged, eyes sparkling with mischief. “Come here, Aanya. Join us,” she said, her voice sultry, an invitation that held a world of possibilities.

Niro looked at Aanya, his desire now split between the two women. Without hesitation, he reached for Aanya, pulling her close. He slipped her T-shirt over her head, revealing her beautiful brown skin. His mouth found her nipples, sucking and teasing them with a fervor that sent waves of pleasure through her. Aanya’s breath hitched as she felt Isha’s hands slide down her body, fingers sneaking into her pants.

Aanya gasped, arching as Isha’s fingers explored her, all while kissing her neck. “Isha…” she moaned, feeling the heat build between her thighs. The mix of sensations—the feel of Niro’s mouth on her breasts and Isha’s fingers between her legs—was overwhelming, sending her spiraling into pleasure.

After a few moments, Aanya turned and captured Isha’s lips in a passionate kiss. Their tongues danced as Niro watched the two women making out, his cock throbbing at the sight. “You two are driving me insane,” he groaned, his voice hoarse with arousal.

Isha giggled against Aanya’s lips, her hand reaching out to stroke Niro’s hard cock. Aanya’s hand soon joined hers, both women working together to tease and please him. “I think you deserve a little more,” Aanya whispered, her fingers trailing along his shaft.

The heat between them was unbearable, and they decided to take things out of the hot tub. The trio moved toward the master bedroom, their lips and hands never losing contact. Niro carried Isha, her legs wrapped around his waist, while Aanya kissed and nipped at his neck as they made their way to the bed.

Once inside, Niro laid Isha down and spread her legs, his eyes glinting with hunger. “I want to taste you,” he whispered before diving between her thighs. Isha gasped, her back arching as Niro’s tongue worked its magic, flicking and teasing her clit. Aanya, unable to resist, climbed on top of Isha, her pussy hovering just above Isha’s mouth.

Isha eagerly licked Aanya, her tongue sending shivers through her. “God, you taste amazing,” Isha murmured between breaths, her voice muffled by Aanya’s body.

As Isha climaxed, her moans filled the room, and they switched positions. Isha crawled down Niro’s body, taking his cock into her mouth while Aanya moved on top of Niro, his mouth devouring her pussy. Aanya’s moans mingled with Isha’s as she watched her friend suck her man’s cock, the sight pushing her closer to the edge.

Aanya finally let go, her climax crashing over her as Niro’s face was covered with her juices. The two women, still breathless, began to beg, their voices husky with need. “Please, Niro,” Aanya panted. “We need you inside us.”

“I want you, Niro,” Aanya breathed, her voice laced with urgency. She felt the warmth pooling in her core, her body aching for him. “I want to feel you deep inside me.”

Isha, not wanting to be left out, chimed in, “And I want to ride that cock too. Please, Niro, let us feel you.” The air was thick with lust, and their words hung in the space between them, urging him on.

Niro grinned, his heart racing at the sight of both women so eager and desperate for him. “You want me, huh?” he teased, a smirk playing on his lips. “Then come get it.”

Aanya wasted no time. She shifted her position, positioning herself above him, her heart pounding with excitement. As she lowered herself onto his hard cock, a gasp escaped her lips. “Oh God, you feel so good,” she moaned, her eyes fluttering closed as she savored the sensation of him filling her completely.

Isha watched, entranced by the sight of Aanya riding Niro, her body moving with urgency. “Can I join?” she asked, her voice sultry and eager.

“Of course,” Niro replied, his gaze darkening with lust. Aanya glanced back, her heart racing as she nodded for Isha to join them.

Isha climbed onto the bed, positioning herself beside Niro. She leaned over, kissing him deeply while Aanya continued to ride him, her body moving up and down, feeling every inch of him sliding inside her.

“God, you’re so tight,” Niro groaned, his hands gripping her hips as he guided her movements.

Aanya felt a rush of pleasure wash over her as she rocked her hips, feeling the pleasure build within her.

“You feel so good, Niro. I want more,” she gasped, her body responding eagerly to his thrusts.

“Don’t stop,” Niro growled, his hands gripping her hips tightly, guiding her movements as she lost herself in the pleasure. “You’re incredible.”

Isha, filled with desire, moved closer to Niro, her body pressed against his side as she reached down to play with Aanya’s breasts, squeezing them gently. Aanya moaned at the sensation, feeling the heat between them grow even more intense.

“Please, let me ride you next,” Isha begged, her eyes glistening with lust. “I need to feel you inside me too.”

“Just a moment,” Niro replied, his voice husky as he watched Aanya ride him with abandon. He could feel himself losing control, every thrust sending shockwaves of pleasure through him.

Aanya leaned back slightly, giving Isha a sultry smile. “I want you to ride him too, Isha. Let’s show him how much we want him,” she encouraged, her voice thick with desire.

With a playful grin, Isha climbed onto Niro’s lap, positioning herself above his cock. “I want it,” she purred, her eyes locked onto his. “I need to feel you.”

Aanya watched with bated breath as Isha lowered herself onto Niro, her body enveloping him as she gasped in pleasure. “Oh, yes,” Isha moaned, her body arching as she adjusted to his size. “You feel incredible.”

Aanya felt a rush of excitement as she saw Isha bouncing on Niro’s cock, her body moving with urgency. “You look amazing, Isha,” she gasped, her heart racing as she leaned in, kissing Isha’s neck and caressing her breasts.

Isha responded with a moan, her eyes fluttering shut as she rode Niro, the pleasure building with every movement. “Harder, Niro,” she begged, her voice thick with desire.

“Give it to me.”

Niro gripped her hips, thrusting upward to meet her movements. “Ohhh, Isha you dirty slut. I love the way you ride me,” he growled, his breath quickening as he felt the heat of her body enveloping him.

Aanya couldn’t resist joining in the pleasure. She leaned in closer, kissing Niro deeply while her hands roamed over Isha’s body. The heat between them was electric, their bodies intertwined in a sensual dance of lust and desire.

“More,” Aanya pleaded, her voice filled with need. “I want to see you both together.”

Niro smirked, relishing the sight of both women begging for him, their bodies moving together in perfect harmony. “You both are incredible,” he murmured, thrusting harder as Isha bounced on him, her moans echoing in the room.

“Please, Niro,” Aanya begged, her voice thick with longing. “Make us feel good. We want to feel everything.”

With a shared understanding, Niro guided Aanya to straddle him again while Isha moved over to his head. Aanya felt the thrill of it all as she lowered herself back onto Niro’s cock, her body fitting perfectly against his.

“Together,” Aanya urged, her voice sultry and filled with desire.

Niro thrust upward as Aanya moved down, their bodies synchronizing in a rhythm that was pure ecstasy. Isha leaned down, kissing Aanya passionately as they both lost themselves in the moment.

“God, you two feel so good,” Niro groaned, his fingers digging into Aanya’s hips as he thrust deeper. The room was filled with the sounds of their pleasure—moans, gasps, and whispers of encouragement as they surrendered to the bliss of the moment.

The tension built within them, pleasure coursing through every nerve ending as they moved together. Aanya leaned back, her hair cascading around her shoulders as she watched Isha and Niro, lost in the intensity of the experience.

“I’m so close,” Niro groaned, his voice thick with need. “I want to feel you both come.”

“Do it,” Aanya urged, her heart racing as she felt the warmth pooling within her. “We want to feel it together.”

With a final thrust, Niro lost control, releasing himself on both women as they reached their peaks together, their bodies trembling with pleasure. The room echoed with moans of satisfaction as they all surrendered to the moment, a tangle of limbs and ecstasy.

As they collapsed onto the bed, their bodies intertwined, Aanya felt a rush of exhilaration wash over her. She couldn’t believe what they had just shared—a moment of pure, unadulterated pleasure that brought them all closer together.

“Wow,” Isha gasped, her breath coming in quick bursts as she lay against Niro. “That was incredible.”

Aanya nodded, her heart still racing as she nestled against Niro’s side, feeling the warmth of his body against hers. “I can’t believe we just did that,” she said, her voice filled with awe.

Niro chuckled, wrapping his arms around both women. “It was more than I ever imagined. You both were amazing.”

Aanya smiled, her heart full as she reveled in the connection they had forged, knowing that this was just the beginning of their journey together.
